# Case-Profitability-Data-Analysis
The data, content, and final delivery I shared on GitHub utilize mock-up data due to confidentiality. This work sample aims to demonstrate my analytical skills, problem-solving approach, and the lessons I learned from the case. 
<br />
### 1. Introduction
The goal of this case analysis is to simulate working as the leadership team of a marketplace company, specifically focusing on Uber. 
<br />
### 2. Obejective
The objective is to identify the most important output metric or financial metric that needs to be moved, determine the most powerful input metric to influence that output metric, and propose 2-3 initiatives to drive the chosen input metric.<br />
<br />
We will delve into different areas of Uber's business, such as mobility, eats, and freight, and developing detailed plans for implementing the initiatives and defining success criteria. The aim is to predict the expected financial impact of the initiatives and provide guidance to the public markets.
<br />
### 3. Results
#### What’s the output operating or financial metric that’s most important to move?
* The output metric that is most important to move is Adjusted EBITDA. <br />
* Reasoning: Adjusted EBITDA is a crucial metric to track as it reflects a company's operational performance, ability to generate cash flow and ability to manage its debt, what are essential for a company’s financial health and growth prospects.<br />
<br />

#### What’s the input metric most powerful to move output metric?
* The two input metrics that have the greatest impact on Adjusted EBITDA are:<br />
  * Revenue: Gross Bookings<br />
  * Operating Expenses: Revenue Cost, Marketing, Research and development (R & D), Administrative Expense<br />
<br />

#### The best 2-3 ideas of initiatives to move that input metric:
* Increase Gross Bookings: <br />
  * Recovery of mobility: expect the growth rate to recover back to pre-pandemic levels<br />
  * Increase the market share in the most revenue-generating regions: <br />In Q4 2022, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) generated 2.1B in revenue, representing a 110% increase from Q4 2021. The question now is whether we can replicate this success in Asia Pacific (APAC) region, which is the next potential region for Uber to expand its market share.<br />
<br />

* Reduce Operating Costs and Expenses: <br />
  * Invest in new technology: AI - To optimize driver and rider matching, routing, dispatching, and to reduce the time and distance of trips <br />
  * Reducing driver and rider acquisition costs: <br />
Uber could use targeted marketing, incentives, and pricing strategies to reduce driver and rider acquisition costs and increase market share, resulting in increased revenue and profitability.<br />
<br />

#### What is the effect size to Adjusted EBITDA with the contribution of the best 2-3 ideas?
* Based on the calculation in the model in attached excel, it is estimated that Uber's Adjusted EBITDA will experience a significant growth rate of 114% by the end of Q4 2023, compared to Q4 2022, resulting in a total of 1423M. The implementation of new AI technology is anticipated to be the most substantial contributor among the four ideas, accounting for approximately 87% of the projected revenue increase of 665M * 214% = 1423M in 2023.<br />
<br />

  * The recovery of mobility contributed to a 9% increase in Adjusted EBITDA. <br />
  * An increase in market share contributed to a 6% increase in Adjusted EBITDA. <br />
  * Investment in new technology contributed to a 1% increase in Adjusted EBITDA. <br />
  * A decrease in driver and rider acquisition costs contributed to a 16% increase in Adjusted EBITDA.<br />

### 4. Limitations/Concerns
* “Net cash used in operating activities and free cash flow for Q4 2022 includes an approximately $733 million (GBP 613 million) cash outflow related to the settlement of outstanding HMRC VAT claims for periods prior to our UK business model change on March 14, 2022.” (Uber Investor 2022)
The one-time settlement mentioned above contributed to the cash flow in 2022. Since it will not be applicable in 2023, it has to be excluded from the 2023 planning.
